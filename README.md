# Reactive Drawing

### About
This program was written as part of a course in reactive programming at 
Mittuniversitet during the fall 2022.

### Instructions
Start Server.java and then run any number of instances of App.java. Anything you draw 
in any of the windows will be communicated and drawn in all the other ones as well.
